The second method is more concise because of the pipe %&gt;%. 2.1.1 Question 1 What is the average of these weights? mean(x) ## [1] 13.41188 2.1.2 Question 2 After setting the seed at 1, set.seed(1) take a random sample size 5. What is the absolute value (use abs) of the difference between the average of the sample and the average of all the values? set.seed(1) avg_sample &lt;- mean(sample(x,5)) # average of the sample of 5 avg_pop &lt;- mean(x) # average of all values abs(avg_sample - avg_pop) # absolute difference ## [1] 2.609875 2.1.3 Question 3 After setting the seed at 5, set.seed(5) take a random sample size 5.

Since the seeds were different (2 vs 3), different random numbers were generated. Therefore, the answer is C: Because the average of the samples is a random variable. "]

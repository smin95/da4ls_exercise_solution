# Exploratory Data Analysis

Note: I have rephrased some parts of the questions for clarity. These changes are **bolded**. Due to the random numbers, the exact values of the answers, despite the same seeds, might differ. So please be mindful of that.

First, upload necessary package(s).

```{r}
library(dplyr) # uplaods the function filter() and %>%
library(rafalib) # important for plotting with base R
```

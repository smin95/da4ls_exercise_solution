# Data Analysis for the Life Sciences with R: Exercise Solutions

Seung Hyun (Sam) Min

This repository contains the Markdown files for the book "Data Analysis for the Life Sciences with R: Exercise Solutions." The book was completed using the BookDown package (www.bookdown.org). 

## Frequently Asked Questions
**1\. Is this the official solution by the book authors?**
No. All of the work was done by myself independently. 

**2\. If it is not official, why did you make it?**
At time of making posting the solutions, there has been no official solution. Also, I wanted to add snippets of tips throughout the solution to help others to navigate the book easily. This book can be quite dense, especially for those who do not know R and matrix algebra. In near future, I would like to translate the R codes of some exercise solutions into Matlab/Python to widen the readership of the book.

**3\. Did you receive permission from the author to make the solution?**
Yes.

# Data Analysis for the Life Sciences with R: Exercise Solutions

Seung Hyun (Sam) Min

This repository contains the Markdown files for the book "Data Analysis for the Life Sciences with R: Exercise Solutions." The book was completed using the BookDown package (www.bookdown.org). 

## Frequently Asked Questions
**1\. Is this the official solution by the book authors?**
No. All of the work was done by myself independently. 

**2\. If it is not official, why did you make it?**
As of right now, there is no published official solution. Also, I wanted to add snippets of tips throughout the solution to help others navigate the book more easily. This book is great but can be quite overwhelming, especially to those who do not know R and matrix algebra. In near future, I would like to translate the R codes of some exercise solutions into Matlab/Python to widen the readership of the book.

**3\. Did you receive permission from the author to make the solution?**
Yes.
